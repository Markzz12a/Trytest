  { q: "What is the green pigment inside chloroplasts?", options: ["Anthocyanin","Xanthophyll","Chlorophyll","Carotene"], answer:2, explain: "Chlorophyll is the green pigment used in photosynthesis."},
  { q: "Which plant tissue moves water from roots to leaves?", options: ["Cambium","Xylem","Epidermis","Phloem"], answer:1, explain: "Xylem transports water and minerals upward."},
  { q: "What does the stem do?", options: ["Makes seeds","Makes food","Supports the plant and carries water","Absorbs water"], answer:2, explain: "The stem supports the plant and transports water and nutrients."},
  { q: "What is phototropism?", options: ["Growth toward gravity","Growth toward touch","Growth toward light","Growth toward water"], answer:2, explain: "Phototropism is growth in response to light."},
  { q: "If the same force is applied to a heavy and light object, the lighter object will:", options: ["Accelerate less","Stay still","Accelerate more","Stop moving"], answer:2, explain: "Lighter objects accelerate more given the same force (F=ma)."},
  { q: "Which surface would produce the most friction?", options: ["Smooth tile","Sandpaper","Ice","Glass"], answer:1, explain: "Rough surfaces like sandpaper create more friction."},
  { q: "Newton's first law is also called:", options: ["Law of Inertia","Law of Motion","Law of Gravity","Law of Forces"], answer:0, explain: "Newton's first law is the law of inertia."},
  { q: "The force of gravity depends on:", options: ["Shape and color","Mass and distance","Size and temperature","Speed and time"], answer:1, explain: "Gravity depends on mass and distance between objects."},
  { q: "A rolling ball will keep moving until:", options: ["Someone watches it","It disappears","A force stops it","It gets heavier"], answer:2, explain: "A force (like friction) is needed to stop motion."},
  { q: "Gravity gives objects their:", options: ["Weight","Speed","Mass","Shape"], answer:0, explain: "Weight is the force of gravity acting on mass."},
  { q: "Which gas do cells need to carry out respiration?", options: ["Carbon dioxide","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Hydrogen"], answer:2, explain: "Oxygen is used in cellular respiration."},
  { q: "Friction always acts:", options: ["In the direction of motion","Opposite to motion","Downward only","Upward only"], answer:1, explain: "Friction opposes motion."},
  { q: "An object at rest stays at rest unless:", options: ["It becomes heavier","A force acts on it","Time passes","It loses mass"], answer:1, explain: "A force is required to change motion (Newton's 1st law)."},
  { q: "What is the name of the process cells use to take in large particles?", options: ["Diffusion","Endocytosis","Osmosis","Exocytosis"], answer:1, explain: "Endocytosis is the process to take in large particles."},
  { q: "Which situation shows useful friction?", options: ["A box moving downhill","A car tire gripping the road","A ball rolling on grass","A sled sliding on ice"], answer:1, explain: "Car tires gripping the road is an example of useful friction."},
  { q: "What is the main purpose of roots?", options: ["Carry water to leaves","Produce seeds","Make food","Support the plant and absorb water"], answer:3, explain: "Roots absorb water and support the plant."},
  { q: "Force equals:", options: ["Mass x acceleration","Mass x speed","Distance x time","Weight x gravity"], answer:0, explain: "Force is mass multiplied by acceleration (F=ma)."},
  { q: "Which of the following is an example of Newton's second law?", options: ["A rocket floating in space","A balloon flying upward","A football kicked harder","A book on a table"], answer:2, explain: "Newton's second law relates force and acceleration; kicking harder accelerates the football more."},
  { q: "Gravity always pulls objects toward:", options: ["Other planets","The center of Earth","The moon","The sky"], answer:1, explain: "Gravity pulls objects toward the center of Earth."},
  { q: "Why do passengers move forward when a car suddenly stops?", options: ["Friction","Speed","Inertia","Gravity"], answer:2, explain: "Passengers continue moving due to inertia."},
  { q: "When you push on a wall, the wall:", options: ["Pulls you forward","Pushes back equally","Breaks immediately","Does nothing"], answer:1, explain: "The wall pushes back with equal force (Newton's 3rd law)."},
  { q: "A rocket moves upward because:", options: ["Fuel pushes gases downward","Friction increases","Air pushes it","Gravity disappears"], answer:0, explain: "Action-reaction: gases pushed down make rocket go up."},
  { q: "If a runner speeds up, she is:", options: ["At rest","Accelerating","Moving at constant speed","Stopping"], answer:1, explain: "Acceleration is change in speed or direction."},
  { q: "Momentum equals:", options: ["Mass velocity","Speed+mass","Acceleration time","Force distance"], answer:0, explain: "Momentum is mass multiplied by velocity."},
  { q: "Which is an example of action-reaction?", options: ["A car at rest","Walking (foot pushes ground)","Gravity pulling objects","A book on a table"], answer:1, explain: "When you push the ground to walk, ground pushes back."},
  { q: "Acceleration is a change in:", options: ["Speed or direction","Force","Gravity","Mass"], answer:0, explain: "Acceleration is change in velocity (speed or direction)."},
  { q: "Newton's third law states:", options: ["For every action, equal and opposite reaction","Objects remain at rest","Energy is conserved","Force = mass Ã— acceleration"], answer:0, explain: "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction."},
  { q: "A parked car is:", options: ["Falling","At rest","Accelerating","In motion"], answer:1, explain: "A parked car is at rest
